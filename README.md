# enlink

A virtual analytics tool for all the entrepreneurs and wannapreneurs 

David  a huge fan of Mark Zuckerberg and he  started up a company along with his friends. They built  their  website and choose to be the drop-out's to launch the product.  Unfortunately their product failed and  they were all hopeless when they realized they were just Business Card CEO's . More than 80% startups die within the first three years of starting but we hardly hear about them. Not just the early stage startups have this risk. Even one of the most innovating company Google have lots of failure stories to share including that of the Google Glass. But what if we have a system to forecast the failure rates Or  if the entrepreneur can evaluate the idea in a simple way. The EnLink is currently prototyped to evaluate the idea by a group of professionals and the customers. The EnLink group will have a  set of the investors, mentors, developers, designers who can evaluate an idea from both the technical as well as the non technical aspects. Also the Enlink rating is going to be the credible ranking for each idea and the investor visibility will be created for those brilliant ideas. David could have been another dropout-billionaire  if he had EnLink tool. Let's  help those people in saving their effort and improve the products using the EnLink.
